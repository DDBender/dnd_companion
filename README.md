# 3.5e Database Companion
App, server and database toolkit for players and DMs. This project provides a robust framework for managing 3.5e campaigns, pre-loaded with official SRD content.
**Note:** This repository contains only Open Game Content (SRD). Private campaign data or non-SRD content must be added manually by the user.

## Project Purpose
This is a personal passion project built for fun and learning. My goal is to combine my interest in tabletop RPGs with a modern tech stack (Flutter, Python, PostgreSQL) and explore the capabilities of AI-assisted development.

## Built With
- **AI Assistance:** Database schemas and boilerplate server logic were co-developed with **Gemini Code Assist**. All generated code has been audited and verified for accuracy.
- **Frontend (planned):** Flutter (Dart) — Cross-platform UI for Android, iOS, and Web.
- **Backend:** Python 
    * **Framework:** Flask (REST API)
    * **WSGI Server (planned):** Gunicorn (Production-grade deployment)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL — Relational storage for complex 3.5e SRD schemas.
